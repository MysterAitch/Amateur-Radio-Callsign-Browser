> An applicant for a new Full Licence (or a Full (Club) Licence) may request a call sign with three trailing letters, using any valid Full Licence prefix in the list, above, except ‘G2’. 
> Call signs using formerly issued prefixes are not available via the licensing portal and must be requested on a paper application form (a fee is payable). 
> A callsign with only two trailing letters or which starts with ‘G2’ is only available if the applicant previously held it. 
> Our policy that a station may change its call sign only in exceptional circumstances remains unchanged though Ofcom may, on occasion, require a station to change its call sign.
